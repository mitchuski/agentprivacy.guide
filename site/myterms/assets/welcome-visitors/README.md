**MyTerms Alliance application package — agentprivacy founding-member materials for IEEE Std 7012™-2025.**

> **V6 note (2026-06-10).** The Privacy is Value model is now at **V6**: `agentprivacy-docs/privacy_value_v6.md` (unified V6 labeling across all canon papers). Two V6 changes touch this package: the reconstruction quantity is now time-dependent, R(t) = (C_S(t) + C_M(t))/H(X) with shelf life t*, replacing static R(d) language wherever reconstruction is discussed; and conjecture citations (C1, C4, C6 and all others) resolve to `agentprivacy-docs/research/CONJECTURE_REGISTER_V6.md` (head C89). Integration plan v3 (V6 edition) is queued; v2 below remains the operative text meanwhile. Date hedge: cite the IEEE 7012-2025 publication as "January 2026" (the precise day is project-asserted, not independently confirmed in the standards record).

This repository is the documentation bundle that accompanies agentprivacy's application to the MyTerms Alliance (Customer Commons) as a founding member. It is the canonical, externally-shareable set of docs explaining *who agentprivacy is, what we bring, and how IEEE 7012-2025 fits into our dual-agent architecture.*

Sibling repositories (local, not yet public):

- `swordsman-blade/` — browser extension implementing the **agreement layer** (IEEE 7012 Individual's Agent, Proposer, Recorder, Auditor roles).
- `mages-spell/` — browser extension implementing the **delegation layer** (the Mage operates inside the Σ-scope of agreements the Swordsman signs).

If those extensions and this docs package disagree, this repository wins — it is the public-facing claim set.

## Canonical version

- **Plan:** `ieee7012_integration_plan_v2.md` (April 22, 2026) — supersedes the February 2026 v1.
- **Privacy Value Model:** V5.4 — three-axis multiplicative gating `Φ_v5 = Φ_agent(Σ) · Φ_data(Δ) · Φ_inference(Γ)`. Any remaining references to V3.1 / golden duality multiplier are historical.
- **Framing:** IEEE 7012 is the **agreement layer**, not "foundational infrastructure." It maps primarily to Σ, provides coarse Δ policy, and is silent on Γ. Compliance is a precondition for measurable Σ — not a substitute for the dual-agent architecture or the cryptographic substrate below.
- **Inscription:** `⚔️📜✍️🔐` (four glyphs — blade, scroll, signature, lock). The decorative `✨` from earlier versions is retired.

## Defensible headline claim

Lift verbatim into publications, pitches, or external conversation:

> IEEE 7012-2025 provides the agreement layer agentprivacy's dual-agent architecture requires. Compliance with the standard is a precondition for the Σ (agent) axis being measurable, and enables bilateral chronicles that can serve as evidentiary basis for VRCs. Standard compliance alone is not equivalent to the full agentprivacy architecture; the standard specifies agreement, not enforcement.

### PDFs of markdown docs

Most letter-coded markdown files have accompanying `.pdf` renders for distribution. The PDFs currently reflect the February 5, 2026 snapshot; regeneration against the April 22, 2026 markdown refresh is pending.

## Working group attribution

Whenever IEEE 7012-2025 is discussed substantively, acknowledge:

- **Doc Searls** — Chair
- **Justin Byrd** — Vice Chair
- **Mary Hodder** — Editor
- **Scott Mace** — Secretary
- **Customer Commons** — Neutral non-profit host; registry at https://customercommons.org/p7012/

The full balloting group is listed on page 7 of the standard PDF and should be acknowledged in any publication that discusses the standard substantively.

## Copyright and attribution rules

When any document in this repository references the IEEE 7012-2025 standard:

- **Paraphrase** all definitions and specifications. Do not quote more than a few words at a stretch.
- **Do not reproduce** Figure A.1 (the sequence diagram). Link to the IEEE Xplore listing or the Customer Commons mirror instead.
- **Customer Commons** is named throughout the standard as the neutral host (footnote 8, Annex A opening); this attribution must appear wherever the standard is referenced.
- **IEEE AI-training disclaimer (p.4):** the standard PDF must not be ingested into AI training corpora without IEEE SA's written consent. Reference and paraphrase the standard; do not bundle the PDF as training material.

## Honesty calibration (what is claimed vs. what is proved)

**Proved:**
- IEEE 7012-2025 is a published, approved standard (approved 4 November 2025; published 20 January 2026).
- §5.4.3 constrains contracts to exactly two parties.
- §A.1 caps negotiation at one round.
- §5.2.4 specifies bilateral immutable recording.

**Architectural claim (defensible, not theorem):**
- Mapping IEEE 7012 primarily to the Σ axis of PVM V5.4 is consistent with §1.1 scope and with V5.4's axis definitions. A reviewer could reasonably argue that `SD-BASE-*` granularity contributes more to Δ than "coarse-grained" suggests.
- The claim that a single-agent monolith scores Σ ≈ 0 requires the separation bound `I(S;M|FP) < ε*` to be empirically measurable, which remains to be demonstrated.

**Conjecture (not load-bearing):**
- That golden-ratio splits or φ-normalized quantities have any special status in bilateral agreement protocols. Treat as speculative.

## How to read this repo

**If you are the MyTerms Alliance / Customer Commons:**
1. `00_executive_brief.md` for the one-page pitch.
2. `00_myterms_alliance_application.md` for the full application.
3. Letter-coded docs A–E for depth on math, technical implementation, diffusion, and sustainability.

**If you are an implementer or standards body looking at our IEEE 7012 integration:**
1. `ieee7012_integration_plan_v2.md` is the current plan.
2. `C_technical_integration.md` for the agreement-layer implementation details.
3. `A_privacy_is_value_equation.md` for how the standard maps onto PVM V5.4.

**If you arrived here from one of the sibling extensions:**
- The extension directory already has a copy of `CHRONICLE_MYTERMS_V2_ALIGNMENT_2026-04-22.md`. That chronicle is the bridge between this docs package and the extension code.
