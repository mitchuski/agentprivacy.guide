## Foundation ↔ Labs ↔ Community Architecture

## Overview

This document explains how agentprivacy sustains long-term contribution to the MyTerms ecosystem through a model that generates commercial value while keeping core infrastructure open. The architecture creates aligned incentives: commercial success requires standard adoption; standard adoption requires implementation quality; implementation quality requires sustained investment.

Privacy is value — behavioral capital, the 7th capital, being systematically extracted by surveillance systems. The Privacy Value Model (three-axis multiplicative gating across Σ, Δ, Γ) shows a persistent value gap between sovereign and surveillance architectures, set by the weakest axis; value is the appropriation share the consent interface lets the subject keep (the historical 678×/31,000× multiples are retired essay-lineage figures, not current facts). This sustainability model ensures the infrastructure to capture that share is sustainably maintained.

### Value Flows

| Direction | What Flows | Why It Works |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| Standards → Implementation | Legitimacy, definitions, legal framework | Open standard enables diverse implementations |
| Implementation → Standards | Field experience, feedback, edge cases | Usage informs standard evolution |
| Implementation → Commercial | Reference code, patterns, community trust | Open source creates addressable market |
| Commercial → Implementation | Revenue-funded development, enterprise learnings | Sustainability enables continued contribution |
| Community ↔ All Layers | Energy, adoption, feedback, evangelism | Network effects compound reach and reputation (the one stock that accumulates) |

---

## What Stays Open

### agentprivacy Core (MIT/Apache 2.0)

**Always open:**
- Swordsman browser extension (consumer version)
- Living documentation (Spellbook, technical specs)
- IEEE 7012 implementation patterns
- Chronicle format specifications
- Integration guides and tutorials
- Community contribution frameworks

**Why open:**
- Standard adoption requires accessible implementation
- Community trust requires transparency
- Network effects require permissionless participation
- Learning requires shareable documentation

### Customer Commons Relationship

agentprivacy does **not** own or control:
- IEEE 7012 standard
- Agreement definitions (SD-BASE, PDC-INTENT, etc.)
- Customer Commons infrastructure
- Agreement registry

We implement what they maintain. Our success depends on their neutrality. Their success depends on quality implementations like ours.

---

## What Generates Revenue

- Private deployment options

**Integration Services**
- Custom MyTerms integration for platforms
- Legacy system compatibility layers
- Enterprise identity system connections
- Regulatory compliance mapping

**Managed Infrastructure**

### Revenue Distribution Model

```
Labs Revenue
    │
    ├── 40% → Continued open development
    │         (Core agentprivacy, documentation, community)
    │
    ├── 30% → Labs operations
    │         (Team, infrastructure, enterprise support)
    │
    ├── 20% → Contributor recognition
    │         (Community members, pattern authors, etc.)
    │
    └── 10% → Ecosystem support
              (Grants to adjacent projects, Alliance contributions)
```

### Why This Works Economically

**For Enterprises:**
- Open source reduces evaluation risk
- Enterprise version adds compliance needs
- Support contracts provide accountability
- Custom integration saves internal development

**For agentprivacy:**
- Open source builds adoption and trust
- Enterprise contracts provide sustainable revenue
- Revenue funds continued open development
- Success aligned with standard adoption

**For the Ecosystem:**
- More implementations strengthen the standard
- Competition improves quality
- Shared patterns lower barrier for all
- Revenue-funded development adds velocity

## Relationship to Non-Profit Partners

### Customer Commons

| Customer Commons Role | agentprivacy Role |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| Maintains agreement registry | Implements agreement protocol |
| Hosts neutral infrastructure | References their canonical definitions |
| Stewards standard evolution | Provides field implementation feedback |
| Non-profit, non-extractive | Commercial, but aligned |

**What we DON'T do:**
- Claim ownership of MyTerms
- Fork or modify agreements without coordination
- Compete with Customer Commons' mission
- Undermine standard neutrality

**What we DO:**
- Implement the standard faithfully
- Attribute properly and consistently
- Contribute learnings back to standards process
- Support their mission through adoption

### BGIN (Blockchain Governance Initiative Network)

Separate but related collaboration:
- agentprivacy co-chairs the BGIN Identity Key Management & Privacy Working Group
- Governance research informs implementation — IEEE 7012 agreements interact with GDPR, CCPA, MiCA, DMA; the standard explicitly leaves this to implementers (§1.3)
- BGIN's Three Graphs architecture (knowledge × promise × trust) has a natural home for signed IEEE 7012 agreements as edges in the promise graph
- BGIN incident response work can reference §5.2.4 (bilateral recorder) as the evidentiary base for privacy incident disputes
- Non-profit governance body, similar model

### Other Non-Profits

| Organization | Relationship Type |
|--------------|------------------|
| Trust Over IP | Technical alignment, potential contribution |
| IIW Community | Community participation, pattern sharing |
| First Person Network | Identity layer integration |
| W3C (DPV) | Semantic vocabulary alignment |
| Ethereum / Privacy Pools | Presented and actively working on compliant anonymity |
| Kwaai AI | Agent architecture collaboration |

## Sustainability Timeline

### Year 1 (2026): Foundation

**Costs:**
- Development time (founder-funded)
- Infrastructure (minimal—open source, cloud-lite)
- Community building (time, not capital)

**Revenue:**
- Minimal—focus on adoption
- Possible: Early enterprise pilots
- Possible: Grant funding for public goods work

**Goal:** Prove the implementation, build community, establish credibility

### Year 2 (2027): Growth

**Costs:**
- Expanded development (contractors/part-time)
- Enterprise support infrastructure
- Community programs

**Revenue:**
- Enterprise contracts (3-5 initial)
- Training workshops
- Consulting engagements

**Goal:** Demonstrate enterprise value, achieve revenue sustainability

### Year 3 (2028+): Maturity

**Costs:**
- Full Labs team
- Global support coverage
- Community grants program

**Revenue:**
- Diverse enterprise portfolio
- Managed services recurring revenue
- Training certification program

**Goal:** Self-sustaining operation funding continued open development

## Risk Mitigations

### Risk: Standard changes in incompatible ways

**Mitigation:**
- Active participation in standards process
- Early access through Alliance membership
- Modular architecture allowing adaptation
- Relationship with working group members

### Risk: Competitors capture enterprise market

**Mitigation:**
- Community goodwill from open contribution
- First-mover advantage in implementation quality
- Documentation and pattern superiority
- Relationships with Alliance network

### Risk: Revenue insufficient for sustainability

**Mitigation:**
- Low fixed costs (remote, lean operations)
- Grant funding bridge (Ethereum Foundation, Protocol Labs)
- Community contribution model reduces burden
- Founder commitment to multi-year runway

### Risk: Open source forked and commercialized

**Mitigation:**
- Brand and community relationship non-forkable
- Enterprise value in support, not just code
- Continuous innovation keeps ahead
- Copyleft-compatible licensing for community protection

## Aligned Incentives Summary

| Stakeholder | Their Incentive | Our Alignment |
|-------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **First Persons** | Privacy under their control | Implementation that actually works |
| **Customer Commons** | Standard adoption | Quality implementation drives adoption |
| **Enterprises** | Compliance, efficiency | Enterprise services built on open core |
| **Developers** | Usable patterns | Open documentation and code |
| **Community** | Shared mission | Revenue funds continued contribution |
| **agentprivacy Labs** | Sustainable business | Success requires ecosystem success |

The flywheel:
```
Standard adoption → Implementation quality → Enterprise value → 
Revenue → Open development → Better implementation → More adoption
```

## Conclusion

The agentprivacy sustainability model creates aligned incentives between commercial success and ecosystem benefit. We need the standard to succeed for our business to work. The standard needs quality implementations for adoption to grow.

This isn't charity. It's architecture.

The blade enforces. The contract binds. The model sustains.
